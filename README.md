### Hi there 👋

My name is Fallon. I am currently learning full-stack web development focusing on HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, Vue.js, and C#. My next area of focus will be c++, so I can explore the intriguing world of game development.<br>
While I enjoy coding immensely, my joy comes from designing the "feel" and look of an app. I'm passionate about art, and creating in general, which I've found actually carries over well to programming.<br>

There is beauty to be found everywhere we look, if we seek it; being able to create it, capture it, and share it is just a bonus.

I enjoy creating using various mediums - it doesn't matter if it's building an application, making decorative cakes/desserts, building a fence, making chainmaille pieces or jewelry, designing costumes, working with clay, painting figurines or canvas, or creative writing/poetry - it all brings me joy. Taking pictures of scenery, animals, and people is also a mild obsession of mine. I typically unwind at the end of the day by cuddling up with my two dogs, and two cats while gaming (usually Xbox, but I am a bit of a console collector).

Aside from coding, my professional background includes:<br>
An Associates Degree with a focus on the foundations of business.<br>
An Esthetics license in the state of Idaho.<br>
Experience in electronics manufacturing, including class 3 target hand-soldering, training of associates, and quality inspection in accordance with IPC-A-610E.<br>
