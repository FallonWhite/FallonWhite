### Hi there 👋

My name is Fallon. I am a software development student. I'm currently learning full-stack web development focusing on HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, Vue.js, and C#.<br>
While I enjoy coding immensely, my joy comes from designing the "feel" and look of an app. I'm passionate about art in every medium, which carries over to programming.<br>
There is beauty to be found everywhere we look, if we seek it; being able to create it, capture it, share it is just a bonus.

Aside from coding, my background includes:<br>
An Associates Degree with a focus on the foundations of business.<br>
An Esthetics license in the state of Idaho.<br>
Experience in electronics manufacturing, including class 3 target hand-soldering, training of associates, and quality inspection in accordance with IPC-A-610E.<br>
